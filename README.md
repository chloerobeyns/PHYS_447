## advection.py
This script solves the advection equation using FTCS and Lax-Friedrich methods with initial condition f(x,t=0)=x over all x and fixed boundary conditions. The results are plotted side-by-side.

## advection_diffusion.py
This script solves the advection-diffusion equation using the Lax-Friedrich method for advection and the implicit method for diffusion. It uses the same initial and boundary conditions as the previous question (advection.py)
